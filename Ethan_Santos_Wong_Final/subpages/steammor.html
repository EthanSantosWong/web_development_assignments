      <p>Steammor Metropolis is the industrial capitol of all of Eathur, producing a majority of all comercial goods in Eathur; these goods can range from clothing to screws to home appliances. Steammor is also layered city, with each layer consituting a different district: the lowest layer is the indusyrial district housing a giant factory that serves as the base to Steammor, the next layer up is a residential district that mainly the less wealthy can live in now a days, the middle layer is a small comercial district turned residental altough one can still find some small lesser know shops there, the layer above is the true commercial and entertainment district boasting a host of plays and musical preformances, finally the top layer of Steammor has large beautiful parks and lavish buildings that house the social elite in Steammor.</p>
      <p>Steammor did not start off as such as grand city, it had a humble start as a simple factory town, that was located on top of its factory. This is because the founder and owner of the factory at the time, Nicoralv Teswake, wanted to create a place that can produce any sort of product. That way if the market so demands the factory can shift its focus on a dime. This strategy was quite successful, and the little burg started accumulating people who were willing to put in a little of elbow grease to make a better living. Soon enough the factory town had to expand in order to keep up with the rapid flow of people, and that expansion was naturally upward. As a hundred and fiftenn years past since it was first founded Steammor grew into the massive five teir structure it is today.</p>
      <p>The factory underneath Steammor has one central smokestack, which is located right in the middle of the city; that smokestack is the symbol and treasure of the city. Spiraling on the side of the central smokestack is a tram that people can take to quickly go between the layers of the city. Another renowned landmark of Steammor is Glemstein Academy, the most prestigious college in Eathur. A lot of powerful thinkers have either graduated from or taught at Glemstein. This has led to students striving to gain entry, and while the academy tries to accomodate them all, one has to cut them off at some point.</p>
