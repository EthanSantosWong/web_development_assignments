      Rantonio Shenjingu was a huawrf (half human, half dwarf) who grew up in the Munipality of Elmon. His family did not have a lot of money so he could not travel too much, however Rantonio's uncle liked to jet set around places and would contsantly recount stories to the rest of the family. Rantonio loved the stories told by his uncle, especially the ones about the Resort Archipelago of Oowan and its various preformances, with preformers doing such daring acts on the trapeeze or being able to tame animals thought to b e wild. Rantonio was absolutely enamored.</p>
      <p>When Rantonio came of age he moved to Oowan. He was able to because Rantonio's parents and uncle got him a train house for his 20th birthday, now he had a way to get to Oowan as well as a place to stay without paying the high rent cost. In Oowan Rantonio found a job as a custodian to a circus in the Entertainment Triangle. Things were looking up for Rantonio.</p> 
      <p>Unfortunately that was not totally the case, for the boss of the circus was absoluetly horrible to the custodian staff members, it was even worse if one was a dwarf or half dwarf. Everything took a turn for the better when two individuals came to the circus claiming they wanted to help the trounced upon circus people. When asked to provide help Rantonio was more than glad to give his all to the two stangers. Rantonio joined forces with two fellow circus staff: Shellma Zellwinslow and Zorag Ria. Together the tree was able to take down the corrupt boss, but in the process the circus had to be shut down. After everything calmed down he met up with Shellma and Zorag, together they ultamitely decided to form a wandering acrobatics trope out of his train house.</p>
      <p>It would be three months after the circus incident that the trio of entertainers would meet back up with their saviors: Illedora Dahlalsi and Sweey Ceankeal, in Val Sarquinn. As repayment for helping them with their corrupt boss in the past the acrobatics trope pledged their allegiance to the two rouges and agreed to help them whenever and wherever Illedora or Sweeny might need it.</p>
