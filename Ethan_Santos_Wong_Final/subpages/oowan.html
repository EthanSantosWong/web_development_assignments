      <p>The Resort Archipelago of Oowan originally was not as large of a establishment as it is today, Oowan was going to be a simple seaside hotel on the west beach of Eathur. However, excatation team, that was preparing the land where the hotel was going be built, discovered a large water elemental crystal not too far off the coast jutting out of a deep maratine trench. When the project manager and director heard about the find, she decided to shift the project and build an artifical island using the large crystal to put the hotel on.</p>
      <p>Years past and the Hotel Oowan gain a lot of revenue. It raked in so much money that the owner of the hotel, Cornwellus Oowan was able to pay for the construction of an additional island. This time the new island would be a grand shopping mall, importing a large variety of luxury goods to offer its guests. This was the first step towards the numerous chains of islands that makes of Oowan today.</p>
      <p>The archipelago consits of three major island chains that congragate at a central island connected to the main land. The central island houses the hotel that started it all as well as a grand fountain that shows off the giant water crystal that helps the island stay afloat.</p>
      <p>To the south of the central island is the Entertainment Triangel; this island chain is the location of the mall from before, an island housing all sorts of sports stadiums where many tournaments are held, and finally an island dedicated to an entire amusement park.</p>
      <p>The eastern island chain is culminates into an entire suburban town, with the islands forming a hexagon. A number of guest took as shine to the living out on the sea and wanted to live there permantly. The then president of the archipelago, Tezzy Lelpent, throughly enjoyed the propsition of having a local community within Oowan and approved of the plan to bulid a town.</p>
      <p>The most recent addition tho the Resort Archipelego of Oowan is the Elyanol Chain jutting out to the west of the central island and steched a single file line to the south west of the Entertainment Triangle. The Elyanol Chain mainly consits of smaller hotel casinos to accomodate the mass popularity of Oowan. However as one continues towards the end of the chain one would find so more "adult" entertainment; the Elyanol Chain was built this way because younger kids gnerally don't like to travel long distances, especially if the trip would be boring. Thus these kids would be more likely to want their parents to take them down the whole length of the chain.</p>
