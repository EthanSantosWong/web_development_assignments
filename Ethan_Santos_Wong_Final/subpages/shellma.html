      <p>Shellma Zellwinslow is an eluman (half dwarf half elf) who is actally the daughter of a considerably wealthy family in Steammor Metropolis. However Shellma quickly realized that the high society life was not her speed, she did not like just how stuffy and uppity it was. Shellma went to Glemstein and graduated in preforming arts because of how much emotion and passion there was in it.</p>
      <p>When she moved out Shellma found a promising job as an acrobat in the circus in Oowan's Entertainment Triangle. Unfortunately, this job was plauged with a horrid boss, he would constantly swindle the preformers and staff from money or crucial equipment for the show, and even worse he would constantly try to get in bed with the female preformers, including herself. He was never able to through the combined efforts of the entire staff, but there was some close calls.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, two strangers came along one day help liberate the staff from such as corrupt boss. Shellma immediately jumped at the chance to get back at the boss for everyone's sake. She, as well as two other staff members: Zorag Ria and Rantonio Shenjingu, played amjor part in taking he sleezy boss down. After the boss was arrested and the circus was shut don she met up with Zorag and Rantonio, they all agreed they did not want to stop being entertainers and together came to ther conclusion to become a wandering acrobatics troupe with the help of Rantonio's train house. Shellma's role in the troupe was the ring leader as well as a comdey partner to Zorag.</p>
      <p>It would be three months after the circus incident that the trio of entertainers would meet back up with their saviors: Illedora Dahlalsi and Sweey Ceankeal, in Val Sarquinn. As repayment for helping them with their corrupt boss in the past the acrobatics trope pledged their allegiance to the two rouges and agreed to help them whenever and wherever Illedora or Sweeny might need it.</p>
