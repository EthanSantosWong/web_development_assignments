      <p>The village of Kinetail actually had a very humble beginning as a checkpoint for explorers who wanted to climb the many mountains of the Zoundpine Range to the north. As time went on people who enjoyed the calm and secluded nature of this village wanted to settle down in Kinetail, and they did.</p>
      <p>Years past and technology advanced, so enough some denizens of Kinetail whom were both smart and adventurous made houses that are fully sustainable and can travel along the ground. Being a town basically founded and inhabited by wanderers these mobile homes became quite popular. So enough the government of Kinetail came up with policies that allowed its citizens to freely travel as they please and still be a residentof the village.</p>
      <p>The Roaming Home policy basically states that a citizen can own a designated plot of land and they can build their house there. If one builds a mobile home they have the freedom to leave Kinetail, their plot of land will be saved. However, the owner of that home must either return their home to their plot of land or send in a correspondence that they want to continue being a citizen of Kinetail at least once per six months.</p>
      <p>At first, mobile homes were pulled by steam engines. Now, new technology has allowed houses to float and even submerge in bodies of water. Recently balloon technology utilizing air elemental crystals have made it possible to have houses that fly in the air as well.</p>
