    The Slightly Lazy Magician
    <div class="row">

      <p>Zorag Ria is a dwelf (half dwarf, half elf) who lived in the town in the Resort Archipelago of Oowan. Due to the enterainment capitol of Eathur was so close his parents frquently brought little Zorag to see many shows in Oowan, this is where he got absoluetly entranced by magic shows and soon enough it became his life goal to be a magician. However, Zorag was quite lazy when it came to anything except his magic tricks, or helping his family or friends. Eventually Zorag was able to land a job as magician's assistant in the circus in the amusment park of the Entertainment Tirangle. Unfortunatley the boss of the circus was quite terrible, from short changing the employees of pay or quality equipment, always taking the praise for the performer's job and even having a sort of grudge against dwarves. Half dwarves were not even safe from his scrutiny</p>
      <p>That is until two indiviuals showed up and stated they heard about the injustice done on the circus staff and wanted to help. Hearing this Zorag was glad someone wanted to help but wanted nothing of it, a revolution was just a bit too much of a hassle. However life had other plans for the dwarf and he ended up playing a major role in bringing down the owner. Zorage had help from two other cirus staff, Shellma Zellwinslow and Rantonio Senjingu. After the boss got taken down and the circus was shut down the Zorag, Shellma and Rantonio did not want give up being entertainer, as such the three decided to come together and form a wandering acrobatics trope through the help of Rantonio's train house. Zorage played the part of flashy magician as well as comedy partner to Shellma.</p>
      <p>It would be three months after the circus incident that the trio of entertainers would meet back up with their saviors: Illedora Dahlalsi and Sweey Ceankeal, in Val Sarquinn. As repayment for helping them with their corrupt boss in the past the acrobatics trope pledged their allegiance to the two rouges and agreed to help them whenever and wherever Illedora or Sweeny might need it.</p>
