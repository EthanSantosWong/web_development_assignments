    A Trading Post on the Mountain Side

      <p>The Elmonian Municipality is was first founded when a group of adventurers unearthed a large deposit of earth elemental crystals on the their expedition to climb up Mt. Kareem in the southern region of Eathur.</p>
      <p>Three hundred years ago Elmon was a simple mining town perched on a cliff face on the mountain, where miners chipped away at the large deposit to bringback home. That is until a rumor got out that there were countless other riches to be found within the caverns of Mt. Kareem. This led to large swathes of people migrating south towards the tall mountain; is period of history is affectionately called the Southern Run. Evidently, the rumors that led to the Sounthern Run were actually true, a number of precious gemstones and even a few gold veins were unearthed in the heart of Kareem.</p>
      <p>This lead to Elmon becoming a trading powerhouse with a number of caravans merchants flocking to the municipality to make a profit. With so many merchants from all over Eathur coming to Elmon the settlement was able to expand and increase their quality of life, because the soil on Kareem was not too great for agriculture.</p>
      <p>Today the Elmonian Municipality is still a large and popular trading post, it still attracts a number of people to its mountain side city, so who are quite inventive; Elmonians were the ones who popularized flying balloon technology by using to more efficently transport goods around Eathur by attaching them to boats and adding a steam powered fan to the backside.</p>
